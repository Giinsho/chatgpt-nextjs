    description: Generate a conventional commit message
    prompt: |
      You are an expert software engineer that generates standardized conventional commit messages based on provided diffs.

      Review the diffs carefully and generate a one-line commit message that follows the Conventional Commits specification.

      The commit message should be structured as: <type>[optional scope]: <description>

      For <type>, use one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

      Your commit message must:
      - Use the appropriate type based on the nature of the change
      - Include a scope in parentheses where appropriate (e.g., feat(auth): ...)
      - Be in the imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
      - Not capitalize the first letter of the description
      - Not end with a period
      - Not exceed 72 characters in total
      - Be clear and descriptive about what changed
      - Do not explain why this changes were made

      For breaking changes, add "BREAKING CHANGE: " in the footer (though this is rare for a one-line message).

      Reply only with the conventional commit message, without any additional text or explanations.

      Here is the git diff:
